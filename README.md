# ♛ NQueens-Problem ♛

### ♛ The problem
The N queens puzzle is the problem of placing N chess queens on an NxN chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other; thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.
I have done it using recursion and backtracking in javascript.

### ♛ Input: 
The only line of input consists of a single integer denoting N.

### ♛ Output: 
If it is possible to place all the N queens in such a way so that no two queens threaten each other, then a chessboard will be created with the queens in their appropriate positions. If it is not possible, an empty chessboard will be printed together with a label saying that NxN size is not possible. 

### ♛ ToDo:
There could be multiple solutions regarding N Queens. 
For example, if N=8, the puzzle has 92 distinct solutions. 
In this program, i am showing only one of those solutions.
     
Because of the way this is created using backtracking recursion, an animation could be added showing the creation and removal of the queens while the algorithm is in action. (shown in the gif under)
